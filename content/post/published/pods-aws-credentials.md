Securely passing AWS IAM credentials to pods running in any Kubernetes cluster

to create an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/connector_IAM_role.html

- First we need to create an IAM role for your cluster
- Register a cluster in EKS with custom name and select the role created above.
- It ask you to download a yaml file (It will ask you only once so be sure to 
  download that yaml file without reloading the page.)

- Apply the yaml an it will bring up a pod

Next is we need to create a
curl -o eks-connector-clusterrole.yaml https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eks-connector/manifests/eks-connector-console-roles/eks-connector-clusterrole.yaml

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/connector-grant-access.html

The thing is, we need an open ID Connect issuer isntalled/connected with our
cluster. That will take time.

- --oidc-issuer-url=<k8s_oidc_issuer_url> # <-- ðŸ”´ update this
    - --oidc-client-id=<k8s_oidc_client_id> # <-- ðŸ”´ update this
